    Adapted from: https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid/blob/master/src/pytorch_fid/fid_score.py
    
    Numpy implementation of the Frechet Distance.
    The Frechet distance between two multivariate Gaussians X_1 ~ N(mu_1, C_1)
    and X_2 ~ N(mu_2, C_2) is
            d^2 = ||mu_1 - mu_2||^2 + Tr(C_1 + C_2 - 2*sqrt(C_1*C_2)).
    Stable version by Dougal J. Sutherland.
    Params:
    -- mu1   : Numpy array containing the activations of a layer of the
            inception net (like returned by the function 'get_predictions')
            for generated samples.
    -- mu2   : The sample mean over activations, precalculated on an
            representative data set.
    -- cov1: The covariance matrix over activations for generated samples.
    -- cov2: The covariance matrix over activations, precalculated on an
            representative data set.
    Returns:
    --   : The Frechet Distance.
